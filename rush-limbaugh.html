After dating for several years, they married on June 5, 2010. He has three previous marriages. Rush married Roxy Maxine Mc Neely, a radio station sales secretary, in his first marriage. At the age of 26, he married on September 24, 1977. On July 10, 1980, they divorced, citing ‘incompatibility.’ Following that, he married Michelle Sixta on May 27, 1994.</p><h2><span id=Rush_Limbaugh-_Professional_Career>Rush Limbaugh- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Rush Limbaugh’s career began when he was 16 years old when he earned his first radio position at KGMO-AM. During his stay here, his air name was ‘Rusty Sharpe,’ from the phone book name ‘Sharpe.’ While working there, he regarded Chicago DJ Larry Lujack as a huge influence on him. Following that, he worked as a DJ at the gospel radio station ‘WIXZ-AM,’ which is Mckeesport, Pennsylvania’s Top 40 station, after dropping out of university in February 1971. He went by the moniker ‘Bachelor Jeff’ while working here, and he worked here in the afternoon before transferring to the morning route. Furthermore, the general manager of the station compared his manner to “early Imus.” Rush, however, was sacked after eighteen months on the job at WIXZ owing to a personality clash with the program director.</p><p>Following that, he started working nights at the non-commercial radio station ‘KQV,’ succeeding Jim Quinn. He was fired, though, after new management took over. He then returned to his parent’s residence. In 1975, Rush began presenting an afternoon show on KUDL, a commercial FM radio station. As a result, he was named the host of a public affairs discussion program. This Saturday morning show was where he refined his technique and delivered increasingly controversial ideas. In 1977, after quitting this show, he established an evening chat show on KFIX. After a brief tenure here, however, he got disillusioned with radio and felt driven to explore a different job.</p><p>In 1979, Rush worked part-time in group sales for the ‘Kansas City Royals,’ an American professional baseball team. Following that, he worked full-time as the director of group sales and special events. He deleted his on-air monicker and began broadcasting under his own name when he returned to radio in 1983. He was hired to replace Morton Downey Jr. on KMNZ-AM, a commercial AM radio station.</p><p>Rush’s success in Sacramento prompted him to establish a new show on WABC-AM in New York City. He made his debut right after the Democratic National Convention and before the Republican National Convention. Similarly, in 1990, he participated in the Rush to Excellence Tour, a two-year series of personal appearances in cities around the country. In December 1990, Rush had “more listeners than any other talk show host,” according to journalist Lewis Grossberger, who defined his style as “bobbing between earnest lecturer and political vaudevillian.” Furthermore, his ascension coincided with the United States’ victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Similarly, Rush backed the war effort while criticizing peace campaigners.</p><p>Similarly, during Bill Clinton’s victory as President in 1992, Rush satirized Democratic Party policies alongside Bill Clinton and the First Lady. As a result, when the Republican Revolution reclaimed control of Congress in the 1994 midterm elections, Rush was named an honorary member of the freshman Republican class, honoring his part in their accomplishment. After a brief run as a professional football broadcaster, he resigned from ESPN in 2003. He made remarks regarding quarterback Donovan McNabb’s press coverage that caused controversy and racism charges.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Rush Limbaugh stands <strong>5 feet 11 inches (71 inches)</strong> tall and weighs about <strong>101 kilograms (222 lbs)</strong>.
