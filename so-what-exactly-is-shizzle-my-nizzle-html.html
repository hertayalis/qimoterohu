I think that he is right, although the occasions on which an expert drug dealer might be called to give evidence in the Chancery Division are likely to be rare."</p><p>Mr Justice Lewison said the fact that the lyrics were hard to "decipher" also mitigated against the case.</p><p>As for Mr Alcee's complaint that he had suffered prejudice from the rap's violent invitation to "string dem up", the judge said he had seen a video of Ant'ill Mob, of which Mr Alcee was a member, dressed as 1930s gangsters.</p><p>As to whether "string dem up" - if those words were used on the album, which was unclear - was an invitation to lynching, the judge said a proponent of capital punishment who said murderers should be strung up would usually be taken to be advocating the return of the hangman rather than lynching.</p><p>The judge said a fundamental weakness in Mr Alcee's case was that the court had no evidence about his honour or reputation or of any prejudice caused.</p><p>He dismissed Mr Alcee's damages claim against East West Records, a division of Warner Music UK, which used Burnin on Heartless Crew's album Crisp Biscuit.</p><p>The judge also rejected a claim by Confetti Records and Fundamental Records, owners of the copyright in Burnin, that the track had been used without permission.</p><p>The judge ruled that a valid contract existed under which East West Records was licensed to use the track on the album.</p><p>Burnin had "proved very popular" and was number one in the official UK Garage Top 10 for the Heartless Crew in November 2001.</p><p>Mr Justice Lewison, at just 50 years of age, is one of the younger members of the judiciary. He was appointed in April this year after 28 years as a barrister.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwwcqnnLCrX2aBdH6QbHBoi59ixKmt02acsZmTqbm6ecisZKygma%2FHrbGMprBmppmvx62xjaGrpqQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./syko-gender-real-name-face-and-age-reveal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SYKO Gender: Real Name, Face And Age Reveal">&larr;
