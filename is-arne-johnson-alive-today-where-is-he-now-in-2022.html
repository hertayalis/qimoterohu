Although Arne Cheyenne was accused of killing his landlord Alan Bono, he insisted that he was not personally responsible for the crime because demons had taken possession of his body.</strong></p><p><strong>According to legend, Arne was the unfortunate victim of a demon that his fiancé’s brother, David Glatzel, had exorcised. Cheyenne, who was present for the purported exorcism, teased the demon to leave David and take possession of him instead. According to Cheyenne, the demon complied, which led to him killing Alan Bono.</strong></p><h2>Is Arne Johnson Alive Today?</h2><p>The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is the most recent production and book to draw inspiration from the original “Devil Made Me Do It” case. Arne Cheyenne is still alive and is surrounded by relatives, leading a peaceful life.</p><p>After being released from prison, Arne Cheyenne began living a private life in secrecy.</p><p>Martin Minnella, Arne’s lawyer, thought the man was possessed. No one could persuade him that the type of stab wounds on Bono’s body could have been caused by human hands. Minnella told The Washington Post, “I went to see Ed and Lorraine [paranormal investigators] and I chose to handle the case after talking to them.</p><p><strong>“They said I had no control over my acts when I was possessed. That remained in my head. Martin informed the Post that the topic of his court case would be religion. “The courts have addressed the issue of God’s presence, and now they will be asked to address the issue of the demonic spirit’s existence.”</strong></p><p>The defense was promptly dismissed by Judge Robert Callahan, who described it as “irrelative and unscientific.” Finding demons “has not risen to that degree of viability where it would be of service to the jury in deciding the case,” he claimed of the “business or pastime.” The “devil made me do it” defense was thus not presented to the jury.</p><p>Martin instead makes a self-defense defense during the roughly three-week-long trial. The jury reached a guilty verdict during a 15-hour deliberation period following the trial. For first-degree manslaughter, Arne received a sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison.</p><p>While incarcerated in <strong>1984</strong>, he married his girlfriend Debbie. The parole board authorized Arne’s early release five years after his punishment since he had been a model prisoner. Arne, who appeared to be weary of the constant media attention, and his wife Debbie preferred a private life. Two children were eventually born to the couple.</p><p>After his release, Arne reportedly worked for a landscaper, according to Lorraine Warren. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It was also produced with the cooperation of Arne and Debbie. Debbie sadly passed away before the movie’s debut. Michael Chaves, the director, said to Digital Spy:</p><p><strong>“This is the tale of Arne and Debbie Glatzel, his girlfriend who later became his wife. She witnessed the murder and the exorcism, and she testified in his favor because she believed. They remained married for the remainder of her life because she stood by that; in fact, she recently passed away from cancer.”</strong></p><p>Some Glatzel family members think that the Warrens made up the possession story to gain publicity.</p><p>When the Glatzel family was unable to explain David Glatzel’s bizarre activities, they turned to paranormal researchers Ed and Loraine Warren for assistance. David overcame his demons thanks to an exorcism that Ed and Lorraine helped to organize. Unfortunately, Arne became a haven for the demons.</p><p>Initially, Brookfield’s then-Police Chief John Anderson told The Washington Post that he didn’t think the incident was uncommon.</p><p>He said,</p><p><strong>“Someone got angry, there was an argument. The moment the public learned about Arne’s purported defense, everything changed. We couldn’t have a straightforward murder, John continued.”</strong></p><p>The Warrens and the Glatzel family presented a unified front at the time. Carl Glatzel, David’s brother, asserted that the Warrens had made up the tale to gain attention in <strong>2007</strong>. For their contributions to Lorraine’s book, The Devil in Connecticut, the Warrens allegedly promised the family millions of dollars, but the Glatzels only received <strong>$2,000</strong>, according to him.</p><p>According to Carl,</p><p><strong>“the Warrens invented a false tale about demons to become famous and wealthy at our expense.” He claimed that David wasn’t possessed but rather had mental health problems that he eventually overcame. David and Carl filed a lawsuit against the Warrens in 2007 for unspecified financial losses.</strong></p><p>Arne and Debbie have consistently supported the Warrens’ account of demonic possession. David’s father, however, disputes claims that his son was possessed. Some contend that the purported exorcisms that are said to have preceded the murder never occurred. Michael Chaves, the director, concurs with the Warrens’ account. The Warrens feel that he was possessed, in my opinion, Michael said.</p><p>They risked their careers to achieve it.</p><p>According to Ed Warren, Arne had a lesson to learn and wouldn’t risk facing demons again. He said to Digital Spy:</p><p><strong>“Possession is not constant throughout the day. It arrives promptly and departs promptly. Arne is aware of what took place. He won’t be foolish enough to challenge the devil once more because he now knows how to ward off everything that happens.</strong></p><p><span style=font-size:18pt>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Personal Details, Career, And Wealth Of Gil Birmingham</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Criminal</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>An Exhaustive Account Of Adnan Syed’s Family And Their Pursuit Of Justice</a></h3>This is the first century of the 21st century in which Adnan Syed has been a free man.
