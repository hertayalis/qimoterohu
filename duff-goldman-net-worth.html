He is a pastry chef and television personality, best known for appearing in the reality television shows “Ace of Cakes”, “Duff Till Dawn” and “Cake Masters” as the owner of Charm City Cakes shops.</p><p>So just how rich is Duff Goldman? Sources state that Goldman has earned a net worth of over $5 million as of mid-2016. His wealth has been accumulated through his involvement in the pastry business, and his numerous TV appearances.</p><h3>Duff Goldman Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>After Goldman was born, his family moved to Kansas, Missouri, but divorced during his teenage years, and he lived in both Northern Virginia and in Sandwich, Massachusetts. He attended McLean High School in Virginia, playing for the school ice hockey team. He then attended Sandwich High School, matriculating in 1993, while at high school becoming a graffiti artist. In 1997 he graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, with a major in History and a minor in Philosophy, then went on to attend the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in Napa Valley, California and Corcoran College of Art + Design in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Goldman started to work professionally when he was 14 at a bagel shop. He later worked in acclaimed restaurants under famed chefs such as Cindy Wolf and Steven Durfee, and then became Executive Pastry Chef at Colorado’s Vail Cascade Hotel. Upon returning to Washington, D.C. he worked as a bread baker at the restaurant Olives.</p><p>In 2000 Goldman moved to Baltimore to become a personal chef, but two years later he started his own business of selling cakes out of his apartment, which were unusual and daring, often involving the use of non-traditional cooking tools such as blowtorches and various power tools, which attracted clients and boosted the business. The home-based shop named Charm City Cakes soon moved into a bigger location, an old church which Goldman converted into a modern bakery. As the business grew, he hired more staff, most of whom were painters, architects and sculptors who began constructing extraordinarily creative cakes.</p><p>As the word about Goldman’s talent spread around, Food Network offered him and his team positions in its reality television series “Ace of Cakes” in 2006, which featured the Charm City Cakes staff as they constructed various cakes, and dealt with customers and deliveries. It became extremely successful, airing for ten seasons until 2010, enabling Goldman to gain high popularity and, considerably add to his net worth.</p><p>In 2009, in collaboration with the team at Gartner Studios, Goldman designed and launched his own line of cake baking and decorating products called Duff Goldman by Gartner Studios. The same year he and his brother Willie released a best-seller book called “Ace of Cakes: Inside the World of Charm City Cakes”. In 2012 Goldman opened another bakery, Charm City Cakes West, and also a cake decorating shop called “Duff’s Mix”, both in Los Angeles.</p><p>The year 2014 saw him co-hosting Food Network’s TV program called “Kids Baking Championship”, portraying children competing against each other in baking presentation, tastes and creativity. He also served as a judge in similar Food Network’s competition shows called “Holiday Baking Championship” and “Spring Baking Championship”. In 2015 he hosted another Food Network reality competition show “Duff Till Dawn”, portraying the cake-decorating teams competing against each other in creating the best cake.</p><p>The same year Goldman released a cookbook called “Duff Bakes: Think and Bake Like a Pro at Home”, which has added a little to his net worth.</p><p>The famous Chef has also appeared on various other shows such as “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives”, “Iron Chef America”, “Chopped”, “Cupcake Wars”, and “Best Thing I Ever Ate”. His talent has been featured in “The Price is Right”, “Jon & Kate Plus 8”, “No Reservations”, “The Tonight Show with <a href=#>Jay Leno</a>“, “The Talk”, “Good Morning America”, “Dr. Oz”, etc. All contributed to his wealth.</p><p>As of 2016, Goldman has starred in Food Network’s new series “Cake Masters”, focusing on his LA bakery. The show portrays his team’s constructing mind-blowing cakes in the six hour-long episodes.</p><p>In his private life, the cake expert is believed to be single. Goldman is involved in philanthropy. In 2008, to support the Great American Bake Sale and awareness for the Share Our Strength charity, he made the world’s largest cupcake, which raised $10,000, which enabled him to enter the Guinness Book of World Records, later rescinded, because the cupcake was made in two parts. He is a member of Tzedakah, a Jewish practice of being devoted to philanthropy to enrich one’s spirituality.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.928914505283><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Duff Goldman</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 17, 1974</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Detroit, Michigan, United States</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Chef, TV chef, Pastry chef, Baker, TV show personality</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Education</td><td>McLean High School, Sandwich High School, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Culinary Institute of America at Greystone, California, Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Jackie Winch, Morrie Goldman</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Willie Goldman</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Jeffrey Adam Goldman</td></tr><tr readability=0.37209302325581><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/duffgoldman</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/duff_goldman</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.375><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/duff_goldman/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2272400</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Guinness Book of World Records (2008)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nominations</td><td>James Beard Award for Outstanding Personality/Host, James Beard Award for Television Program, On Location</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Iron Chef America" (2005), "Ace of Cakes" (2006), "Cake Masters" (2016), "Kids Baking Championship" (2014), "Holiday Baking Championship", "Spring Baking Championship", "Duff Till Dawn" (2015)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=6.2826086956522><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2.5774647887324><td>1</td><td>Had worked for <a href=#>Cindy Wolf</a>, who was his inspiration to becoming a chef.</td></tr><tr readability=2.4705882352941><td>2</td><td>Has worked for <a href=#>Todd English</a> and as a pastry chef in Vail, Colorado.</td></tr><tr readability=1.1304347826087><td>3</td><td>Close friends with <a href=#>Guy Fieri</a> and <a href=#>Nathan Lyon</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>4</td><td>Chef/owner of "Charm City Cakes" (opened in 2000) in Baltimore, Maryland.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>Plays bass guitar in an instrumental indie rock band.</td></tr><tr readability=0.96296296296296><td>6</td><td>Brother of <a href=#>Willie Goldman</a>.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Cake Masters</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Movie executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Duff Till Dawn</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series executive producer -
