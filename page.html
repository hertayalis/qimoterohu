I’m not talking about store-bought frozen dinners, but the soups, stews, and casseroles that I make ahead and freeze myself. Stored and reheated the right way, these freezer meals are just as flavorful as they were on the day they were made. When I have a stash of them on hand, making a delicious, healthy dinner is as simple as heating one up! Below, you’ll find my favorite freezer meals to make ahead, along with my best…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These no-bake energy balls are my favorite healthy snack. Sticky, sweet, and studded with chocolate chips, they taste like little balls of cookie dough, but they’re made with simple, wholesome ingredients. Dates bind them together, oats add fiber, and walnuts and almond butter pack them with protein and healthy fats. They’re super-quick and easy to make in the food processor, and they keep for weeks in the freezer or fridge. At least they do in theory. If you love these energy balls as much as we do, there’s no way they’ll stick around that long. Between speedy breakfasts and on-the-go…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Where to start with this cauliflower pasta recipe?! Friends, this one’s a keeper. Caramelized roasted cauliflower mingles with ruffly pasta, capers, parsley, and toasty, lemony breadcrumbs. I love the mix of bright and briny flavors and how the tender cauliflower contrasts with the breadcrumbs’ crunch. The combination feels elevated, but don’t let it fool you. This cauliflower pasta is surprisingly simple to make. Jack and I ate it for dinner early last week…and then again last night. Can you tell that we’re hooked? Cauliflower Pasta Recipe Ingredients To make this cauliflower pasta recipe, you’ll need these simple ingredients: Cauliflower, of…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Wait! Don’t toss that stale bread on your counter. Use it to make homemade breadcrumbs instead! Up until recently, Jack and I rarely had stale bread hanging around the house. We just weren’t bread people. Every so often, we’d get a good crusty loaf to enjoy with a pot of soup, or Jack would make his own bread for a fun weekend project. But regular old sandwich bread? Nope, we never had it on hand. But over the last year or so, Jack has started making sandwiches for lunch instead of going out or ordering in like he used to.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I make roasted cauliflower almost every week. It’s SO simple, healthy, and absolutely delicious. The florets come out of the oven with crisp, golden brown edges and a rich, nutty flavor. They’re perfect for serving as a side dish, tossing into a salad, a grain bowl, or a pasta…or eating straight off the baking sheet. You’ll find my go-to roasted cauliflower recipe below, along with my best tips and tricks for cooking it perfectly every time. I’ve also shared a few of my favorite ways to serve roasted cauliflower. Yes, this roasted veggie is great on its own, but with…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>The next time you’re in the mood for an easy baking project, roll up your sleeves and try one of these healthy muffin recipes! They include a recipe for every classic muffin you can think of – blueberry, banana, zucchini, chocolate chip, and more – but they’re all made with wholesome ingredients like whole wheat flour, almond flour, Greek yogurt, and maple syrup. Still, they deliver everything you want in a muffin, healthy or otherwise. They’re moist, tender, puffy, and lightly sweet. Two (or three) for me, please! Before you get to baking, here’s a tip: all these healthy muffin…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If your lunch or dinner rotation is in need of a refresh, try adding these tofu broccoli bowls to the mix! They have a hearty base of brown rice, crispy tofu for plant-based protein, and roasted broccoli and radishes for color and crunch. Avocado adds creamy richness, and my go-to carrot-ginger dressing takes them over the top. They’re nourishing, satisfying, and, above all, delicious! They also happen to be perfect for meal prep. The dressing keeps well for up to a week, and you can cook the rice, tofu, and broccoli up to 3 days in advance. Store the components…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I know it’s just a simple sauce, but this carrot ginger dressing is still one of my favorite recipes on Love & Lemons. It’s creamy, zingy, vibrant, and bright, with a slight sweetness from the carrots and bite from the ginger. It calls for 6 ingredients (including salt and water!), and it keeps in the fridge for up to a week. I make a batch whenever I get the chance. This carrot ginger dressing is exactly what I want to drizzle over a grain bowl at lunchtime, toss with a side salad at dinner, or use as a dipping sauce…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Every time I make this air fryer broccoli, I wish I’d doubled the recipe. It’s so simple, but something about the combination of the broccoli’s crisp edges and savory, salty seasoning makes it completely addictive. Even if I intend to serve it as a side dish or add it to a grain bowl, I find myself eating it straight out of the air fryer basket. It’s that good! Air Fryer Broccoli Recipe Ingredients To make this recipe, you’ll need these simple ingredients: Broccoli, of course! You’ll just need the florets for this recipe. If your broccoli has a long stalk…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>After my first bite of this air fryer tofu, I immediately thought, “What took me so long?” It’s crispier than any tofu I’ve baked in the oven, and it’s SO much easier to make than deep-fried or pan-fried tofu. No sticking to the pan, no splashing oil… If you want to make really crispy, crunchy tofu at home without a lot of fuss, you have to try this air fryer tofu recipe. Air Fryer Tofu Recipe Ingredients Here’s what you’ll need to make this air fryer tofu recipe: Tofu, of course! Nothing less than extra-firm here! Softer types of tofu…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If there’s one recipe that made me an Instant Pot convert, it was this Instant Pot brown rice. Let’s be honest: cooking brown rice on the stove is no one’s favorite thing to do. It requires 40+ minutes of hovering nearby, nudging the heat up and down to keep the pot at a lively simmer. But this Instant Pot brown rice recipe is almost entirely hands-off. Once you get it going, you can focus on making the rest of your meal without giving the rice a second thought, knowing that it’ll come out fluffy, tender, and perfectly cooked.
