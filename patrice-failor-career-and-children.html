As the spouse of American attorney James Comey, she rose to fame in the media. Her spouse held the position of Federal Bureau of Investigation’s seventh director.</strong></p><h2><span id=Wiki-like_bio_early_life_and_education_of_Patrice_Failor>Wiki-like bio, early life, and education of Patrice Failor</span></h2><p>Patrice Failor, the spouse of James B. Comey, was born in the United States on November 10, 1960. The majority of her early years were spent in Iowa and Northern Virginia, where she also completed her education.</p><p>She attended The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, after high school and graduated in 1982. She completed her master’s in counseling not long after earning her bachelor’s.</p><h2><span id=Patrice_Failor_served_as_a_juvenile_court_special_advocate>Patrice Failor served as a juvenile court special advocate.</span></h2><p>As an advocate and attorney, she has had a prosperous career. She volunteered at the Bridgeport Superior Court not long after earning her master’s degree in counseling.</p><p>Patrice became involved in a number of “Juvenile Justice Issues” at this time, which gave her the chance to serve as a special advocate in juvenile court. She joined the Connecticut Judiciary Committee shortly after that in 2016 and testified there to bring attention to the issue of abandoned children.</p><p>In addition to advocating on behalf of the impoverished street children, Failor and her husband Comey have fostered other youngsters throughout the years.</p><h2><span id=She_met_James_Comey_her_husband_when_she_was_a_college_student>She met James Comey, her husband, when she was a college student.</span></h2><p>As we previously discussed, Patrice Failor is well-known for being James Comey’s wife. In the presence of close friends and family, the pair tied the knot in 1987.</p><p>Introduced by a mutual friend, the prosperous couple Failor and Comey initially met at the cocktail party at their college. They both attended William & Mary College to further their education.</p><p>In one of the interviews, Comey claimed that although he couldn’t recall the precise moment of their first meeting, she had nominated him to be their dorm council president. James claims that following that, he was introduced to Failor by a friend, and they had a three-hour conversation nonstop.</p><p>“I spoke about myself to her for three hours.” I fell madly in love with her right away as she was willing to let me talk about myself—a habit that she has since broken.</p><h2><span id=Failor_is_a_grandmother_as_well_as_the_mother_of_five_children>Failor is a grandmother as well as the mother of five children.</span></h2><p>Patrice Failor is a married woman with five children. All of her children, Abby, Claire, Brien, Kate, and Maurene, get along well with her.</p><p>Maurene, their eldest daughter, is a Harvard Law graduate. She graduated in 2013 and is currently employed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York as an assistant U.S. attorney.</p><p>Similarly, Brien, one of her sons, played basketball for Ohio’s Kenyon College. With a height of 6 feet 8 inches, he was a very skilled player in college.</p><p>She is also a grandmother, in addition. Apparently, her spouse frequently posts pictures of their grandchild to Instagram. James initially revealed a picture of his grandchild back on May 1, 2019. “Life can be so good,” he wrote in the post.

Collin Comey, who was born on August 4, 1995, reportedly passed away on August 13, 1995, a mere nine days later. The bacterial Group B Strep infection was the cause of mortality.</p><p>Patrice explained Collin’s death in a post for The Baltimore Sun a month after her son passed away, while also bringing attention to the illness. She made it very apparent that taking precautions is advised and that treatment for the infection is available. As she wrote</p><p>I don’t want my story to scare anyone. But I can’t let my gorgeous boy’s passing be just another GBS tragedy in a long line.</p><h2><span id=Patrice_and_Her_Husband_Are_Adopting_A_Soft_Spot_for_The_LGBTQ_Community>Patrice and Her Husband Are Adopting A Soft Spot for The LGBTQ Community</span></h2><p>Patrice has a warm place for the LGBTQ community despite her silence on the subject. Indeed, she and Comey went to a Broadway production about a lesbian and her homosexual father back in 2017.</p><p>They were surprisingly impacted by the story to the point where they were crying nonstop. In a statement to The New York Times, the show’s producer said that when they first saw the cast, they were crying.</p><h2><span id=A_Rapist_Held_Patrice_Failor8217s_Husband_Hostage>A Rapist Held Patrice Failor’s Husband Hostage</span></h2><p>Few people are aware that Failor’s brother and spouse were abducted by a rapist when he was just sixteen years old. He was taken prisoner by a felon known as the Ramsey rapist in 1977, which is when the crime occurred. At their Allendale residence, the man allegedly threatened them with a gun.</p><p>Thankfully, Comey was able to confine them to a restroom before eventually contacting the cops to come to their aid. A newspaper reported on the event and said,</p><p>After being imprisoned in a bathroom as the burglar searched the house, the Comey brothers managed to escape through a window, only to run into the man once more on their lawn. A large manhunt was started when the brothers fled back inside the house, closed the doors, and phoned the police.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Aeko Catori Brown, Jordana Lajoie, and Cogeian Sky Embry."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":67}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/aeko-catori-brown/"}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jordana-lajoie/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cogeian-sky-embry/"}{"1":67}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>counselor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Karl Glusman Parents | Meet Steven Glusman and Elaine Mary Burke</a></h3>Karl Glusman is a well-known American actor whose portrayal of Francis in the 2022 psychological thriller Watcher earned him widespread renown.People became enamored with Glusman's charismatic fea <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Does Tommy Paul Practice Judaism Or Christianity?</a></h3>After Tommy Paul became the first American man to reach the semifinals at Melbourne Park, his religion quickly became a hot issue on the internet.Tommy Paul, is an American professional tennis pla <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Iñaki Godoy | Ethnicity, Nationality And Family</a></h3>Inaki is a young, well-known actor who has become well-known on Netflix thanks to several productions.He is most known for playing Bruno in the Mexican criminal drama soap opera "Who Killed Sara?" <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rm6CoZpOkunC8wK2popuVYrOitcuoqWabkaeypr6MmqWdZZOdtq2w0Z6laA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-lopez-goes-inspiring-graphic-tee-furniture-shopping.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Jennifer Lopez Goe Furniture Shopping in an Inspiring Graphic Tee">&larr;
