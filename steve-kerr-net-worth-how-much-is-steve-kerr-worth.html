During this period, he truly came into his form as a player and drew the attention of NBA scouts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Kerr was born to an American academic Malcolm H. Kerr(father) and Ann Zwicker Kerr (mother)</p><p>His grandfather, Stanley Kerr, was also a helpful personality as he volunteered with the Near East Relief after the Armenian Genocide and rescued women and orphans in Aleppo and Marash before eventually settling in Beirut. His father Malcolm Kerr was killed by members of the Shia Lebanese militia called Islamic Jihad on the morning of January 18, 1984, at the age of 52 while he was serving as president of the American University of Beirut.&nbsp;</p><p>He has three siblings.</p><p>He is the current head coach of the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

He has a net worth estimated at $18 million.</p><p>He’s currently in the fourth year of a five-year contract with “Golden State Warriors” for $25 million, which gives him an annual salary of $5 million</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><a href=#>Ghgossip.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqyrnq6VYrimvtFmpZ6sXay8s8DHZp%2Bor12iwqS0jKKqZqukmsOmecqeqatlp6S%2FtbSO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./daniel-rodriguez-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tragic News!
