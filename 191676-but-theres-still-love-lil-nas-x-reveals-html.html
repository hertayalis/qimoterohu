He cites the deaths of Nipsey Hussle and Juice WRLD, as well as the passing of his grandmother in 2018. Of that loss, he <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/lil-nas-x-grammys-old-town-road-1203469735/>said</a>,</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>“She was the first person close to me who died. It was devastating. And it made me a hypochondriac: I’d wake up, heart racing.

This included smoking marijuana heavily.</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>LOSING HIS CONFIDENCE</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>At the height of his booming career, <a class="ae -U" href=#>Lil Nas X</a> bravely came out as gay. But this didn’t do much to boost his morale. Back in September, he took a step back by canceling a couple of shows.

Even trying to get her better — things didn’t quite work out. But there’s still love…”</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Lil Nas X’s parents were never married. He was only five when they split up and was made to live with his grandmother. At nine years old, he began living with his father who gained custody of him.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>To this day, Lil Nas X remains close to his dad who has learned to embrace his sexuality. He admits they’re still at an adjustment period and thinks it too soon to introduce any man.
