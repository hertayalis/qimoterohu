The charges against Correll include embezzlement, fraud, and official misconduct.</p><p>Correll served as the captain of the Somerset Police Department for several years before his resignation in 2019. As a Police officer, Correll was known for his hard work and dedication.</p><p>However, an investigation uncovered evidence of misconduct and corruption. According to the investigation, he had allegedly embezzled funds from the department’s evidence room and engaged in fraudulent activities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Michael-Correll-1.jpg><p>The investigation also revealed that Correll had allegedly used his position of power to intimidate and threaten other officers who had questioned his actions. The charges against Correll are severe and could result in significant penalties.</p><p>Embezzlement and fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines. Tampering with evidence charges carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines.</p><p>Official misconduct charges can result in up to ten years in prison and a $10,000 fine.</p><h2>Michael Correll Arrest Has Shocked Many</h2><p>The allegations against Correll have sent shockwaves throughout the Somerset community.</p><p>Many residents who knew Correll had expressed disbelief at the charges against him.

However, when officers abuse their power, they erode the public’s trust in law enforcement.</p><p>The Somerset Police Department has taken steps to address the allegations against Correll and to restore the public’s trust. The department emphasized its commitment to accountability in a statement released after Correll’s arrest.</p><p>It also expressed its willingness to work with state investigators and take appropriate action fully.</p><p>The department has also implemented new policies and procedures designed to prevent similar misconduct from occurring in the future.</p><p>These policies include enhanced oversight of evidence handling and storage, increased ethical behavior and conduct training, and more rigorous background checks for new hires.</p><p>The charges against Correll serve as a reminder that no one is above the law, no matter how high their position or how respected their reputation is. The public expects law enforcement officers to uphold the law and always act honestly.</p><p>When officers fail to do so, they not only harm the individuals and communities they are supposed to protect, but they also damage the reputation of law enforcement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57zKKaoZmVoXqku9GrnKWkXZu8s7nEq2Ssp52av7Sx02aamqiklravecKhmKuflah8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sandra-douglass-morgan-parents-ethnicity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sandra Douglass Morgan Parents, Ethnicity, Nationality, Husband, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth">&larr;
